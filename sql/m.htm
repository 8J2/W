SQL,../
<h2>WHY</h2>
<p>This project is for archiving SQL that I wrote for my
 college classes. None of this is that complex, though some notable code is:</p>

<ol><li><h3>ski.sql</h3>
<p>This script generates tables filled with example data for a
 ski resort DB. As well as a few views and indexes to
 demonstrate working with these tables</p></li>
<li><h3>plsql</h3>
<p>Contains tons of PLSQL queries</p></li></ol>

<h2>GET</h2>
<p>The source code is <a href="/gh/sql">
 here</a>, get it with:</p><pre class="sh">
git clone http://github.com/porterswanstrom/sql</pre>
