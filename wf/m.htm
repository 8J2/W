WinForms,../
<h2>WHY</h2>
<p>This project is for archiving the various WinForms that
 I've made while in college. None of these are complex, but
 a few notable programs are:</p>

<ol><li><h3>chess_monitor</h3>
<p>This program lets a user move/take pieces on a chess board
 and save/load the state of the chess board via a save file.
 There are 3 boards the user can switch between in case
 multiple games need monitored simultaneously</p></li>

<li><h3>txt_to_html</h3>
<p>A very basic text to HTML converter that only supports
 paragraphs, headers, and non-inline links</p></li></ol>

<h2>GET</h2>
<p>The source code is <a href="/gh/wf">
 here</a>, get it with:</p><pre class="sh">
